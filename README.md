# Arm Assembly Projects #

########################

This is a collection of my projects made while attempting to learn Armv7 Assembly, mostly through the tutorials proided by @lauriewired on youtube, all of these programs so far are tested and developed within the CPUlator web application, there is a breif overview of the projects below.

>> Custom_ev.s: a very simple program, calls a custom exit value and then quits.
>> maths-operator-practice: again quite a simple program, takes two values and adds them, then multiplies the result with the second value, then subtracts the first value, storing each result in a seperate register then quits the program
